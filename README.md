# RecipeTool

This recipe converter is the version 2.0 of my first personal project, which I started halfway through first quarter of learning computer science at RTC. I chose this project because I enjoy baking recipes from places I have lived abroad, and I used to go through recipes and research how to convert quantities of different types of ingredients from metric to US and vice versa.

## How It Works
Recipe calculations
 - The main menu gives options to perform various cooking calculations, such as converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit. This will be expanded to convert other variables, such as pan sizes and number of servings.

Recipe string converter
 - Splitter: splits a one-line string into different elements using ' ' and '/' as delimiters. '/' is used to identify fractions. A doubly linked list is created for each line, and each element is a separate node.
 - IngredientLineSorter: sorts and converts elements created by the Splitter into different types found in an ingredient list (Quantity, Unit, Ingredient). (This is currently in rough draft form.)

## Inspiration
In addition to my own cooking efforts, this project is inspired by a website I came across which allows visitors to paste an entire recipe into a text box, and it displays the converted recipe. I was curious about how it works, so this became my personal project. I plan to keep working on this to add more functionality as my skills grow.
