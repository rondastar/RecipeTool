# RecipeTool

This recipe converter is the version 2.0 of my first personal project, which I started halfway through first quarter of learning computer science at RTC. I chose this project because I enjoy baking recipes from places I have lived abroad, and I used to go through recipes and research how to convert quantities of different types of ingredients from metric to US and vice versa.

I came across a website that allows visitors to paste an entire recipe into a text box, and it displays the converted recipe, and I was curious about how it works. While this app isn't very far along yet, I plan to keep working on this to add more functionality as my skills grow.
